# Image Classifier
> Created in Spring 2019 using MATLAB.


# Project Overview
This project serves as an image classifier. It allows users to select a region within an image of choice and retrieves the most similar video frames. Similarity scores are computed using bag-of-words modeling and k-means clustering. Results are based off of a dataset of over 6,600 images.

# Acknowledgments
My former professor provided the template code, which can be found within the /provided_code/ directory. Besides this, I implemented the rest of the source code with a coding partner. Lastly, this README.md was created by myself.
